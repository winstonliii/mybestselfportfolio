                    Winston's true character shines through in his dedication
                    and resilience, particularly evident in his commitment to
                    swimming. At the age of five, he dove into competitive
                    swimming, showing up for every practice regardless of rain
                    or shine. I vividly recall one winter day when he was in
                    third grade. The sky was dark, the rain poured down
                    relentlessly, and a thick mist rose from the pool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this dreary setting, one figure braved the water, that
                    was Winston. The stadium was eerily quiet before the
                    rhythmic splashes of water and Coach Beth’s instructions
                    echoed throughout the indoor stadium. Yet, amidst the cold
                    and the solitude, I felt a sense of overwhelming pride. It
                    was then that I knew without a doubt: that Winston was
                    destined to conquer whatever challenges lay ahead of him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Winston’s remarkable innovation shone brightly from an early
                    age, evident in his uniquely creative scientific projects.
                    Whether it was crafting a shirt embellished with handprints,
                    constructing an electronic circus illuminated by colorful
                    lights powered by solar panels, designing a functioning
                    tsunami emergency device, or fashioning a model of a
                    spaceship and moon station complex, Winston’s projects were
                    consistently imaginative and distinct. However, his most
                    striking display of creativity and computer science acumen
                    came at the age of thirteen when he designed and assembled
                    his own computer for research. In a mere five days, he
                    procured and assembled all the necessary parts, culminating
                    in the creation of his first personal computer.

                <p className="mt-2 text-12 leading-loose text-gray-600">
                  My father is undoubtedly the most hard-working and dedicated
                  person I will ever know. Raised in the bustling city of
                  Beijing, China, in a two-person household of him and my
                  grandmother, my father learned early on that nothing in life
                  is given and that success is defined by consistent hard work.
                  In his early years, my father devoted much of his time to
                  caring for my grandmother, managing her medications,
                  administering her shots, and attending to her needs.

                  After completing primary/secondary school, he graduated from
                  Peking University Medical School in Beijing, the most
                  distinguished medical school in China. From there he moved to
                  the United States where he received his MD from the University
                  of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago and completed his
                  residency at Charles R Drew University of Medicine and
                  Science. Currently, he practices family medicine with a focus
                  on dermatology and geriatrics at a private practice clinic in
                  Alhambra, California with his 37 years of experience. He is an
                  accomplished golfer, an avid investor, and the founder of his
                  own company and an entire skin care product line.

                    Your best self would have been at age six. Whenever I took
                    the three of you out, you always brought your brother in for
                    me in case he got lost. When your sister was little,
                    whenever she cried you would run over to her and hug her to
                    keep her from crying and give her your favorite toys.
                    However, you were also very naughty at six years old.

                    February 21st, 2009, your sixth birthday. You woke up at
                    5:00 am to go to your swim meet. It was very cold and rainy,
                    but you were not afraid and you stayed until the end of the
                    game. We prepared a cake for your team members too. We
                    celebrated your birthday together and I was so touched; I
                    really wanted to cry!

                    This is the training before your sixth birthday, it was
                    pouring rain that day and all the other kids didn't come so
                    you were the only one in at the pool. Shivering in the cold
                    you were still insisting on swimming. We were so touched
                    even your coach got in the water to swim with you.

                    You have always loved your younger siblings. You have been a
                    leader since you were a child, always helping your younger
                    siblings to play nicely together. When they would have a
                    conflict you would still give them some reasoning which was
                    especially cute. You have also always been a very strong
                    hands-on person since you were a child. At the age of six,
                    you were able to complete very complex Lego at stunning
                    speeds and recreate them on your own easily. You also have a
                    very good sense of visualization and a sense of
                    three-dimensionality when it comes to drawings and designs.
                    Even with your own designs you would demolish them and
                    re-build them, constantly innovating and reforming new ones.
                    You are a role model for your younger siblings and we have
                    always been proud of you!

                  Short Biography
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-2 text-12 leading-loose text-gray-600">
                  My mother has consistently been a pillar of support in my life
                  and her attention to detail and confidence has never ceased to
                  impress me. My mother spent the majority of her childhood
                  living in Shanghai, China in a household consisting of her, my
                  grandmother, and my grandfather. From a very young age, she
                  loved playing volleyball. Fueled by her competitive spirit and
                  passion, she started playing competitively at the age of nine
                  before quickly taking the role of the main attacker or outside
                  hitter as her dedicated position. My mother often shared
                  stories of the frigid winters, when she would joyfully return
                  after long days of volleyball practice with soaked cold hair
                  and bruised forearms before coming home to enjoy some 包子
                  Baozi.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2 text-12 leading-loose text-gray-600">
                  Throughout her years of competitive play, she would lead her
                  team to countless tournament victories, ultimately earning the
                  title of one of Shanghai's top three athletes at the time. She
                  then traveled to study and work in Singapore before coming to
                  the United States for a vacation where she stumbled upon my
                  father. I will always see my mother as a beacon of strength
                  and compassion who strives for perfection in all of her
                  ventures.
