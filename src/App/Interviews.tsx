                    the three of you out, you always brought your brother in for
                    me in case he got lost. When your sister was little,
                    whenever she cried you would run over to her and hug her to
                    keep her from crying and give her your favorite toys.
                    However, you were also very naughty at six years old.

                    5:00 am to go to your swim meet. It was very cold and rainy,
                    but you were not afraid and you stayed until the end of the
                    game. We prepared a cake for your team members too. We
                    celebrated your birthday together and I was so touched; I

                    you were the only one in at the pool. Shivering in the cold
                    you were still insisting on swimming. We were so touched
                    even your coach got in the water to swim with you.

                    siblings to play nicely together. When they would have a
                    conflict you would still give them some reasoning which was
                    especially cute. You have also always been a very strong

                    At the age of six, you were able to complete very complex
                    Lego at stunning speeds and recreate them on your own
                    easily. You also have a very good sense of visualization and
                    a sense of three-dimensionality when it comes to drawings
                    and designs. Even with your own designs you would demolish
                    them and re-build them, constantly innovating and reforming
                    new ones. You are a role model for your younger siblings and

                <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                  My mother has consistently been a pillar of support in my life
                  and her attention to detail and confidence has never ceased to
                  impress me. My mother spent the majority of her childhood
                  living in Shanghai, China in a household consisting of her, my
                  grandmother, and my grandfather. From a very young age, she
                  loved playing volleyball. Fueled by her competitive spirit and
                  passion, she started playing competitively at the age of nine
                  before quickly taking the role of the main attacker or outside
                  hitter as her dedicated position. My mother often shared
                  stories of the frigid winters, when she would joyfully return
                  after long days of volleyball practice with soaked cold hair
                  and bruised forearms before coming home to enjoy some 包子
                  Baozi.

                <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                  Throughout her years of competitive play, she would lead her
                  team to countless tournament victories, ultimately earning the
                  title of one of Shanghai's top three athletes at the time. She
                  then traveled to study and work in Singapore before coming to
                  the United States for a vacation where she stumbled upon my
                  father. I will always see my mother as a beacon of strength
                  and compassion who strives for perfection in all of her
                  ventures.

                  "Winston's true character shines through in his dedication and
                  resilience, particularly evident in his commitment to
                  swimming. At the age of five, he dove into competitive
                  swimming, showing up for every practice regardless of rain or
                  shine. I vividly recall one winter day when he was in third
                  grade. The sky was dark, the rain poured down relentlessly,
                  and a thick mist rose from the pool.

                  In this dreary setting, one figure braved the water, that was
                  Winston. The stadium was eerily quiet before the rhythmic
                  splashes of water and Coach Beth’s instructions echoed
                  throughout the indoor stadium. Yet, amidst the cold and the
                  solitude, I felt a sense of overwhelming pride. It was then
                  that I knew without a doubt: that Winston was destined to
                  conquer whatever challenges lay ahead of him.

                <br />
                <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                  Winston’s remarkable innovation shone brightly from an early
                  age, evident in his uniquely creative scientific projects.
                  Whether it was crafting a shirt embellished with handprints,
                  constructing an electronic circus illuminated by colorful
                  lights powered by solar panels, designing a functioning
                  tsunami emergency device, or fashioning a model of a spaceship
                  and moon station complex, Winston’s projects were consistently
                  imaginative and distinct.

                <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                  However, his most striking display of creativity and computer
                  science acumen came at the age of thirteen when he designed
                  and assembled his own computer for research. In a mere five
                  days, he procured and assembled all the necessary parts,
                  culminating in the creation of his first personal computer."

                My father is undoubtedly the most hard-working and dedicated
                person I will ever know. Raised in the bustling city of Beijing,
                China, in a two-person household of him and my grandmother, my
                father learned early on that nothing in life is given and that
                success is defined by consistent hard work. In his early years,
                my father devoted much of his time to caring for my grandmother,
                managing her medications, administering her shots, and attending
                to her needs.

              <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                After completing primary/secondary school, he graduated from
                Peking University Medical School in Beijing, the most
                distinguished medical school in China. From there he moved to
                the United States where he received his MD from the University
                of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago and completed his
                residency at Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science.

                    "For me, at least, Winston is at his best in intense
                    situations where everyone involved is panicking, except for
                    him. That type of composure is something I've always
                    associated him with, and it's honestly the reason why I kind
                    of see Winston as the older brother I never had. I mean,
                    older brother doesn't exactly encapsulate our friendship as
                    well as I'd like, but for lack of better terms, I'll just
                    stick with it. So while I could easily talk about a moment
                    when Winston accomplished something massive, I'll talk about
                    a much more mundane time I'm not even sure if Winston
                    remembers.

                    It was the second or third day of Freshman orientation, and
                    I somehow managed to cut my finger pretty badly on my water
                    bottle. I remember the feeling of panic when I saw my finger
                    gushing out blood for a simple cut. Even though the obvious
                    solution here was to just go back to my room and get a
                    bandaid, I was paralyzed from the shock of the sheer amount
                    of blood that came from a literal water bottle and the fact
                    that I was going to have to leave my newfound friends at the
                    time over something so stupid.

                  <br />
                  <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                    I remember the feeling of a million different anxious
                    thoughts that seemed to be in my head all at the same time
                    as I sped-walked back to my room. I was thinking things like
                    how I was so stupid for letting this happen to me and how I
                    was about to lose my chance to befriend these new people I
                    just met at a time when I was feeling very lonely from just
                    moving into college. And then I came across Winston, who I
                    just barely knew at the time. He saw how much I was bleeding
                    and asked me what was up, and my first instinct in my
                    somewhat panicked state was to ask him to help me, even
                    though there was realistically nothing I needed him there
                    for.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                    Just like that, he walks with me back to my room just to
                    apply that singular bandaid to my one finger. And I just
                    remember how much better I felt having Winston there by my
                    side. Seeing someone like Winston remain calm in a situation
                    that expects you to be everything but calm really helps you
                    calm down, at least for me. He was able to calm me down
                    enough to the point where I realized that it was kind of
                    dumb of me to ask him to help me with a singular cut on a
                    finger, and I even just asked him to put it on for me to
                    make it seem like I really needed him there.

                  <br />
                  <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                    But while I might have thought I didn't need him there at
                    the time, I now know that I absolutely needed him. That
                    display of composure over a small issue like a finger cut
                    would translate over to many more shared moments with much
                    more intense problems, where I would see Winston remain
                    unfazed in spite of everything. Experiencing these moments
                    over and over again with Winston truly inspired me to try to
                    be more like him when facing challenging situations where it
                    feels like nothing is going your way. I think everyone could
                    use someone like him in their life because my life has not
                    only changed directly from Winston's abilities but also in
                    the changes I made in my own life that he just so naturally
                    inspired me to do."

                  Nathan is my close friend that I have known for as long as I
                  have been in college, but it often feels as if I have known
                  him for far longer. I first met Nathan through a mutual friend
                  group that would go to church every Sunday morning. We first
                  bonded due to our shared major in Molecular and Cellular
                  biology with an almost identical schedule. He later hosted me
                  and some friends at his place in McLean, Virginia, and has
                  since played an integral part in my college experience as a
                  friend and a source of motivation and support.

                <p className="mt-2 leading-loose text-gray-600 text-12">
                  Nathan consistently inspires me to work harder with his
                  inability to receive low marks on anything academic. Nathan is
                  a genuinely kind person who is always free to help you in
                  need, academically or emotionally and is dedicated to all
                  those that are lucky enough to befriend him. Nathan has
                  essentially been my roommate for three years now and I am
                  grateful to have him as a friend I can always count on.

                  Xian has been a close friend and companion that I have known
                  for over ten years. I first met Xian in middle school after I
                  moved. From the beginning, I was inspired by his conviction
                  and resilience. It's difficult to recall a time when Xian
                  remained in low spirits for more than a brief moment. Even in
                  the most treacherous and difficult situations, he is somehow
                  always the first to bring attention to the positive aspects,
                  displaying his unwavering optimism regardless of
                  circumstances.

              <p className="">
                Upon reflecting on the insightful interviews shared by my family
                and friends, there was one constant that emerged. In all four
                perspectives of my best self, there was the common theme that
                resilience defines my character and leadership. The stories told
                by those closest to me, though varied in context, converge on
                this central tenet of my life.

              <p className="">
                My father's recount of my early commitment to swimming in
                adverse conditions highlights resilience and illustrates a
                broader pattern of facing challenges head-on. His pride in my
                dedication, seen through the lens of cold, solitary swim
                sessions, is a testament to a formative resilience that has been
                key to my identity. This narrative, despite it being from my
                childhood, has evidently laid the foundation for the person I
                have become, someone who is unafraid to dive into the depths,
                both literally and metaphorically.

                The portrayal by my mother adds another dimension, emphasizing
                my inherent compassion as well as my resilience, despite it also
                being from swimming. She mentions that from a young age, I had
                the instinct to care deeply for my siblings and to extend a hand
                in their moments of need showing the compassion aspect of myself
                that has guided my interactions and decisions. Despite not
                noticing it at first, I believe that this blend of compassion
                and resilience has helped me to create meaningful relationships
                and stay steadfast under difficult conditions.

                Nathan's reflection provides a more recent glimpse into how
                these early attributes have translated into my current self.
                Particularly my ability to remain “unfazed” in turbulent
                conditions that would normally send others into panic. He
                mentions me serving as a constant source of calm and reassurance
                which also contributes to the overarching theme of resilience.
                His mentioning of my willingness to walk him back to his room
                may seem trivial at first, but in retrospect, I now have a
                better understanding of how doing something that you may think
                is inconsequential may have a much larger effect on someone
                else. This incident combined with Nathan’s mention of my ability
                to remain composed again relates back to the constant theme of
                empathy and resilience.

                Lastly, Xian's perspective affirms the continuous growth of the
                person I am. His anticipation of our future ventures, grounded
                in mutual growth and friendship, inspires a forward-looking
                mindset that values constant improvement and learning. Xian’s
                recognition of my ongoing development reinforces that resilience
                and compassion are not static traits but evolving strengths.
                This draws back to the common theme of resilience in my journey.

                Collectively, these accounts weave an image of myself who
                embodies resilience tempered with compassion. This quality of
                resilience is a value that I strive to uphold and as I move
                forward, whether in academic environments or professional
                settings, I aim to carry with me this same quality to allow me
                to inspire by action, lead by example, and grow through
                reflection. I find safety and am ever grateful knowing that my
                path ahead is not one to be walked alone, but one that will be
                shared by the companionship of my family and friends who have
                stood by me through the various chapters of my life.

                I hope to always be a person who is resilient and compassionate.
                I strive to refine the positive traits that others see within my
                best self while also developing areas of my leadership and
                character that can be improved upon. I will always be indebted
                to the people close to me as they have empowered me to navigate
                my personal challenges and interpersonal relationships with both
                a steady hand and a kind heart.
