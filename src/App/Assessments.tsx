                      An Time Where I Demonstrated Commander (ENTJ-A)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While working on a project for my User Interfaces and
                      Mobile Applications course, my personality and leadership
                      traits of Commander (ENTJ-A) were instrumental as I led a
                      diverse team in developing a mobile app. I believe that
                      the strategic vision my group and I developed combined
                      with intuitive thinking were key in setting our project's
                      direction, while my preference for structure and
                      decisiveness ensured efficient task allocation and
                      progress. We were tasked with planning and designing a
                      mobile app to be shippable for companies seeking to manage
                      clubs and organizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My group consisted of myself and three other teammates
                      with varying skill levels in full-stack app development
                      and software engineering. During our development, we were
                      faced with a conflict over a design feature of the
                      hierarchy assignment to the users of our app
                      (coaches/instructors, members, parents, admin). I was able
                      to lead constructive discussions with my team which
                      ultimately led to a compromise that balanced innovation
                      with practicality, removing certain redundant features to
                      allow for a more streamlined sign-up process and back-end
                      user management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This experience showcased my leadership capabilities as
                      well as the importance of balancing assertiveness with
                      flexibility and emotional intelligence. It was a
                      relatively accurate demonstration of how my Commander
                      traits can drive a team towards success, while also
                      reminding me of the continuous growth needed in my
                      leadership styles to adapt to varying team dynamics and
                      project challenges.

                      An Interesting Observation
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After reflecting on my results, I came to an interesting
                      realization. In the past, I have taken the 16
                      personalities Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test many times
                      for insight into myself or when comparing with my
                      colleagues. I realized that up until college I would
                      always be in the analyst personality type, often carrying
                      between Architect (INTJ-A) and Commander (ENTJ-A).
                      However, in all the past few times I have taken the MBTI
                      test, my results have always assigned me under Commander
                      (ENTJ-A). I believe that this change, from introverted to
                      extroverted, may be attributed to the diverse experiences
                      and challenges I encountered during college that have
                      pushed me to adopt a more outgoing and assertive approach
                      to situations. As a result, I have become more comfortable
                      stepping into leadership positions, advocating for my
                      ideas, and actively seeking out opportunities to make an
                      impact. While my core values and analytical mindset remain
                      a constant, I have learned to harness my extroverted
                      qualities to effectively navigate complex social dynamics
                      and actively share ideas with my peers and colleagues.
                      Below is a screenshot of my MBTI results from freshman
                      year:

                  I have taken the the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
                  assessment regularly, I have consistently received results
                  that align with the Commander (ENTJ-A) personality type.
                  Here's a deeper look into why these traits resonate so
                  strongly with my personal and professional self:
                </p>

                <p>
                  As someone who naturally steps into leadership roles, I
                  believe it is accurate that my personality aligns with that of
                  a Commander (ENTJ-A). This classification reveals my bold,
                  imaginative, and strong-willed nature and my passion for
                  driving change and fostering innovation. Through strategic
                  thinking and decisive action, I thrive on building momentum
                  and achieving goals, always eager to transform creative
                  visions into reality.

                  Energy: 54% Extraverted My energy score indicates a slight
                  preference for extraversion over introversion. While I still
                  do greatly appreciate and enjoy solitary activities, I have
                  learned to draw energy from engaging with people and the world
                  around me through social interactions and external stimuli.
                  This balance suggests that while Ienjoy leading and
                  influencing your environment, Ialso value personal reflection
                  and independent thought. I believe that this balanced trait
                  allows me to lead with confidence and enthusiasm while valuing
                  moments of reflection and solitude, ensuring a well-rounded
                  approach to both personal and professional interactions. To
                  further refine my energy trait, I aim to work on deepening my
                  engagement in both group settings and solitary activities.
                  While I draw energy from social interactions, enhancing my
                  active listening skills and empathy in conversations can lead
                  to more meaningful connections. Similarly, dedicating time to
                  learn more about myself through introspection can enhance my
                  self-awareness and decision-making, providing a stronger
                  foundation for my leadership and personal growth. Mind: 83%
                  Intuitive My strong intuitive nature drives me to look beyond
                  the present, focusing on future possibilities and abstract
                  concepts. This propensity for imagination and strategic
                  thinking empowers me to foresee long-term potential, guiding
                  my decisions and actions toward solutions and leadership. This
                  trait is one that I believe is essential for my effective
                  visionary leadership and innovative problem-solving. While my
                  intuitive nature is a strength, I aim to ground some of my
                  future-oriented thinking with more practical steps and
                  immediate actions that can make my visions more attainable. I
                  plan to do this by iterating faster when working on projects
                  rather than focusing too heavily on overly specific features
                  and details, which I tend to find myself often doing.
                  Balancing big-picture thinking with attention to detail will
                  ensure that my ideas are not only visionary but also
                  executable. Furthermore, I seek to engage more with the
                  present details, and incorporating feedback can enrich my
                  strategic planning and implementation processes. Nature: 61%
                  Thinking This indicates a rational and analytical approach to
                  problem-solving. I prioritize logic and objectivity in my
                  decision-making process, relying on critical thinking and
                  analytical skills to navigate challenges. This thinking
                  preference ensures that I approach problems rationally, making
                  tough decisions with clarity and precision, a key asset in
                  effective leadership and project management. To balance my
                  rational approach, I aim to develop greater emotional
                  intelligence that can help me make more holistic decisions
                  that resonate with a broader audience and foster a more
                  inclusive team environment. I want to practice more on
                  acknowledging the emotional aspects of decision-making and the
                  value of empathy in understanding team dynamics. Tactics: 72%
                  Judging My judging preference signifies a natural inclination
                  towards planning, organization, and decisiveness. I thrive in
                  structured environments where there are clear goals, and where
                  the outcomes are measurable with fast feedback. This trait not
                  only enhances my ability to lead projects to successful
                  completion but also ensures that I can provide clear direction
                  and stability within my teams. While my preference for
                  planning and organization still can be improved upon,
                  incorporating flexibility into my approach can prepare me
                  better for unexpected challenges. I seek to become more
                  adaptable and pivot when necessary. Identity: 56% Assertive I
                  consider myself to be a moderately assertive individual, as I
                  seek to approach challenges with confidence and resilience,
                  maintaining a positive outlook even under pressure. This
                  self-assuredness allows me to inspire confidence in others,
                  fostering a team environment where innovation and creativity
                  are encouraged, and setbacks are viewed as stepping stones to
                  success. I believe that for my identity results, focusing on
                  balance is key. While confidence under pressure is crucial,
                  practicing humility and openness to learning from mistakes can
                  foster a growth mindset. Engaging in reflective practices to
                  understand my limitations and areas for improvement can lead
                  to a more nuanced perception of myself and others.

                    1. Owls highly value both their goals and their
                    relationships. They view conflict as a problem to be solved
                    and seek a solution that achieves both their goals and the
                    goals of the other person. Owls see conflicts as a means of
                    improving relationships by reducing tensions between two
                    persons. They try to begin a discussion that identifies the
                    conflict as a problem, and strive to resolve tensions and
                    maintain the relationship by seeking solutions that satisfy
                    both themselves and the other person.

                    2. Teddy Bears typically value relationships over their own
                    goals; if forced to choose, Teddy Bears will often sacrifice
                    their goals in order to maintain relationships. Teddy Bears
                    generally want to be liked by others, and prefer to avoid
                    conflict because they believe addressing it will damage
                    relationships. Teddy Bears try to smooth over conflict to
                    prevent damage to the relationship.

                  <p className="leading-loose">
                    In the Accommodating role, I indeed find myself prioritizing
                    the needs of others tremendously and a desire to maintain
                    peace and goodwill. This approach has helped situations
                    where preserving a relationship is more critical than
                    winning an argument. However, I am also aware of the
                    potential downsides, such as neglecting my own needs or not
                    addressing critical issues head-on.

                  <p>
                    Similarly, the Collaborating style resonates with my belief
                    in finding win-win solutions. As an "Owl," I strive to
                    identify mutual goals and work towards resolutions that
                    satisfy everyone involved. This approach has enabled me to
                    resolve complex problems while strengthening relationships,
                    building trust, and encouraging open communication.

                  <p>
                    Despite my comfort with accommodation and collaboration, I
                    recognize the importance of balance and flexibility in
                    conflict management. Therefore, I am actively working on
                    enhancing my Compromising skills. This style, characterized
                    by the "Fox," represents a middle ground between meeting my
                    own goals and attending to the relationships involved.

                  <p>
                    Improving in this area means embracing active listening and
                    clear communication, allowing me to understand opposing
                    viewpoints better and navigate toward mutually beneficial
                    solutions. By bettering my compromising abilities, I aim to
                    become more adept at reaching agreements that respect
                    everyone's interests, thereby improving the outcomes of
                    conflict situations.

              A Time When Demonstrated Accommodating and Collaborating Conflict
              Management (Owl and Teddy Bear)

                While working on a presentation for my Object Oriented Software
                Engineering course, I was able to apply my Accommodating and
                Collaborative conflict management skills effectively. The
                project required collaboration with a diverse team, each member
                having unique ideas and perspectives. Early on, we faced
                disagreements regarding the project's direction and the
                implementation of certain features.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this situation, my Accommodating style came into play as I
                wanted to listen to my team’s concerns and suggestions before I
                shared my take on the situation. During a heated argument
                between my group and TA, I took steps to acknowledge the
                validity of each team member's input, which helped to
                de-escalate the situation and help our team return to a positive
                atmosphere that ensured that everyone felt valued and heard.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, I knew that merely accommodating wouldn't be enough to
                complete our project successfully. This is where my
                Collaborating style began to come in. I was able to facilitated
                a series of discussions aimed at identifying our common goals
                and the essential features for our project. By encouraging open
                dialogue and leveraging the strengths of each team member, we
                were able to develop a unified vision for our project. In the
                end, we were able to successfully reach a middle ground in our
                implementation strategy and created a well rounded presentation
                that helped us score a calm 15/15 for our Product Pitch
                Presentation.

                Reflecting on this experience, I learned the importance of
                adapting my conflict management style to the situation at hand.
                While my natural tendency is to accommodate and collaborate, I
                saw firsthand the value of compromising and maintaining
                flexibility. I've learned that while maintaining harmony is
                important, it's equally crucial to address and resolve conflicts
                constructively to achieve shared goals.

              In applying these insights to my daily interactions and leadership
              roles, I continuously strive to assess the context of each
              conflict and choose the most appropriate management style. My goal
              is to not only resolve disputes effectively but also to learn from
              each experience, enhancing my ability to lead, collaborate, and
              build lasting relationships.

              crucial for effective leadership and personal growth. By sharing
